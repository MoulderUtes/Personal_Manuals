# Documents
*Cause Im sick of a cluttered home directory*
## Theory
A place for all the files that don't deserve their own home folder. 

## Rules
1. Make sub directories for everything. There should not be any files sitting in \$HOME/Documents.
2. Follow naming conventions listed [Here](../../../../../Data_Management/naming_conventions.md)
3. Follow file structure conventions listed [Here](../../../../../Data_Management/file_structure_conventions.md)
