# Home Directory
*Because I'm sick of losing files*
## Theory
Have a Home Directory that is cross distribution (NOT cross architecture). It also needs to be tidy and not massive. 
We are going to follow both the [XDE Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s02.html) and the [Glib User Directory Specification](https://docs.gtk.org/glib/enum.UserDirectory.html). 
 ## Overview
 1. Follow XDG and GLIB specifications
 2. Keep it as clean as possible
 3. Set Permissions Correctly for use case
 4. Create a new home per architecture
