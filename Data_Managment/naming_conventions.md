# Naming Conventions
*Because why likes to use a backslash*
## Theory
The whole purpose of naming conventions is to make like easier to find and identify files. Using the ./File_Structure_Conventions.md in combination with these conventions insure anyone can find and identify files. This means that you can say go pull that files off this computer and anyone should be able to find and identify the file. 
## Rules to follow
### Major Rules
1. Name makes sense and is concise
2. If multiple versions include version number (name-yyyymmdd-v1.1.1)
3. Use any widely agreed on standard first (i.e XDE, etcs)
4. Don't be afraid to use directory hierarchies (i.e; project/file.ext over ProjectFile.ext)
5. CAPITALIZE VERY IMPORTANT FILES (i.e; README, LICENCE)

### Specific Rules
1. Directorys are uppercase
2. files are lowercase
3. Spaces => _
4. Version separated by - (semver.org)
5. Don't use / or \ for compatibility reasons
6. Try to eliminate $p3c1A1 characters
7. Plane text files don't get extensions.txt (markdown.md is ok)

## Examples
* Photos - name/object_enviroment-yyyymmdd.ext
* Project - name-yyyymmdd-vX.X.X.ext
* School - paper_name-yyymmdd.ext
